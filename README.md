Basically this  is a nodeJs and expressJs based project.

I developed this project to practice concepts of expressJs like handlebars. 

This is fully responsive and dynamic web application which shows the current weather using api

This app contain 3 web pages Home , weather and about.

From weather you can enter your city name and you can get current weather status of your city.

I choose to make this beacuse many developer made this application but they all using mainly HTML, CSS and JavaScript but
I make it using express and send all html pages from backend after making them responsive and dynamic.
